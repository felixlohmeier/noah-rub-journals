                    <abstract lang="eng">While crossing the border in order to find his comrades in Belgium, Holocaust survivor and Bundist Herman Goldberg was arrested by the British military under the suspicion of being a Communist, a Trotskyist or even a militant member of the Zionist underground. After he had “proven” his “innocence,” he still remained incarcerated for months – to his torment together with high-ranked German Nazis. In a painfully composed letter, Goldberg turned to his comrades in New York who apparently were overwhelmed by the many problems risen by this unique source of post-Holocaust martyrdom of a political activist. Arguing that the collateral prisoner Goldberg suffered this deeply insulting treatment because he was not a member of the movements the British were afraid of, this article presents a full translation of this newly discovered document as well as a contextual interpretation.Bielefeld University / Johns Hopkins University</abstract>
