                    <abstract lang="eng">The revelation of Islam in Arabic, its emergence in the Western Arabian Peninsula, and its&amp;nbsp;acquaintance with Biblical literature seem to be clear indications for Islam’s birthplace and its religious&amp;nbsp;foundations. While the majority of academic scholarship accepts the historicity of the revelation in Mecca&amp;nbsp;and Medina, revisionist scholars have started questioning the location of early Islam with increasing&amp;nbsp;fervour in recent years. Drawing on the isolation of Mecca and the lack of clear references to Mecca&amp;nbsp;in ancient and non-Muslim literature before the mid-eighth century, these scholars have cast doubt on&amp;nbsp;the claim that Mecca was already a trading outpost and a pilgrimage site prior to Islam, questioning the&amp;nbsp;traditional Islamic and Orientalist view. Space, thus, plays a prominent role in the debate on the origins&amp;nbsp;of Islam, although space is almost never conceptually discussed. In the following paper, I challenge the&amp;nbsp;limited understanding of space in revisionist as well as mainstream scholarship. For the most part, this&amp;nbsp;scholarship is not really interested in the multi-religious landscape sui generis, but understands early&amp;nbsp;Islam either as a stable or an unstable entity that either reworked or digested the impact of Judaism&amp;nbsp;and Christianity. In contrast, my contention is based on the view that Islam emerged neither “in” Mecca&amp;nbsp;nor anywhere else, but that Muslims’ practical and symbolic actions produced such places as Mecca,&amp;nbsp;Medina, and the Ḥijāz as the central places of Islam. My argument is threefold: Firstly, the production&amp;nbsp;of the Meccan space and its central meaning for Islam were mutually dependant, gradual processes.&amp;nbsp;Secondly, the creation of an exclusively Muslim space in the Ḥijāz conversely inscribed multi-religiosity&amp;nbsp;into the general topology of early Islam. Thirdly, the early history of Islam hints at practices of un/doing differences, exemplified by instances of sharing, the creation of ambivalence, and processes ofpurification. Moreover, my contribution questions the way in which research on the origins of Islam has&amp;nbsp;become a meaningful object of knowledge about the “true” nature of Islam against the background of&amp;nbsp;populist discourses on Islam.</abstract>
