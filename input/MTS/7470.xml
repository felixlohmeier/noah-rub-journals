	<dc:title xml:lang="en-US">Disability Movements National Policies and Transnational Perspectives â€“ Introductory Remarks</dc:title>
	<dc:creator>Stoll, Jan</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">The special issue Disability Movements: National Policies and Transnational Perspectives examines different Disability Movements and their transnational entanglements in the 20th century. The articles in this issue enquire into the adaptions and transfers between different national movements and into the establishment of networks across borders nbetween like-minded people, who shared similar aims. Furthermore, they ask about nprocesses of how knowledge and strategies were transferred, exchanged and adapted. Therefore, the issue combines three different research strands: First, disability; second, new social movement research; and third, transnational approaches. The adoption of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006 highlights the need of considering disability rights activism on national as well as international levels.</dc:description>
