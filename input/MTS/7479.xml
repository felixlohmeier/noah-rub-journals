	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">The Arab Spring, including the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia, displayed a strong female presence and the active involvement of women voicing their dissatisfaction with authoritarian regimes. Even though the contribution of women during the Jasmine Revolution is beyond dispute, the question regarding the role of women in post authoritarian Tunisia has remained unanswered. It further remains debatable if the active involvement of women in the revolution has been transformed into a stronger societal position and greater influence in political decision-making processes for women in post-revolutionary Tunisia. The article analyses the repercussions of the Jasmine Revolution, and its context, on subsequent discourses regarding the position of women in post-authoritarian Tunisian society and on their involvement in political decision-making processes after Ben Ali’s departure. Through the course of the article the outlined theoretical approaches discussing the role of women in post-conflict society and in political decision-making processes are contrasted with the interviews conducted with high-ranking women in Tunisian administration mapping the first year of the transition process after the Jasmine Revolution with a particular focus on the role of women in post revolutionary Tunisia.</dc:description>
