	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">A considerable trade in slaves took place along the Portuguese-German colonial border, as the German colonial administrators learnt after some years. Their means and willingness to act against the slave hunters and traders were limited at best, especially since the definition of slavery to be applied to the African realities on the ground was uncertain. It was, therefore, more practical to remain in the position of bystander, demanding that the neighbouring Portuguese colonial officials intervene and abolish slavery.</dc:description>
