	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">Core drilling with diamond impregnated segments is a common process for the machining ofconcrete or reinforced concrete. These materials are characterised by their structure consisting ofvarious components. This inhomogeneity influences the cutting process due to changing processforces or varying chip formation. Therefore an analysis regarding the material separation of the singlecomponents (cement stone, aggregates like basalt, steel as reinforcement) as well as of thecompound materials is necessary. As a basis to analyse the core drilling process and in order togain detailed knowledge concerning the material separation process of reinforced concrete and itscomponents, scratch tests with single diamonds and varying process strategies were conducted. Inanalogy with the core drilling process, circular grooves were produced. For the scratch tests steel,cement stone, basalt, high performance concrete and reinforced concrete were used as samplematerials. One test series was conducted on a machining centre with the focus on process forcesunder varying process parameters such as cutting velocity or feed speed. Further experimentsfocused on the analysis of the development of the scratches due to repeated scratching. For thismicroscopic investigation a tribometer in combination with a large-chamber scanning electronmicroscope was used.</dc:description>
