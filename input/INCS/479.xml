	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">This edition of the bibliography retrieves and bundles articles on the history of Communism and related topics published during the years 2013 and 2014 in scholarly journals and serials worldwide. The items are sorted by journal titles and issues. In case a journal published less than two articles on the relevant topics during 2013 and 2014, these articles are listed under "Other journals" at the end of this bibliography. We have tried to make the citations as complete as possible, yet in some cases it was not possible to retrieve the page numbers. If available, the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) has been added.This bibliography is the result of a lengthy process of research, retrieval and evaluation. Various web resources have been explored, the most important of them were the Labour History Serials Service (http://serials.labourhistory.net), the H-Soz-u-Kult periodicals directory (http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/zeitschriften/), the Russian Scholarly Electronic Library (http://elibrary.ru). Still, several periodicals had to be retrieved and indexed in conventional libraries. A number of readers and correspondents have provided us with otherwise inaccessible tables of contents.1204 journal contributions on the history of Communism and related topics have been investigated and retrieved for the years 2013 and 2014 – a fact hat demonstrates the international and interdisciplinary importance of this research field. We are aware that some publications still might be missing. Please send in further information about journal articles published during 2015, as well as 2013-2014 articles that might be missing here. We continue to look for correspondents on the different countries and world regions.</dc:description>
