	<dc:title xml:lang="en-US">The Changing Landscapes of Cross-Faith Places and Practices</dc:title>
	<dc:creator>Sing, Manfred</dc:creator>
	<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">The present special issue&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Entangled Religions&amp;nbsp;has emerged from a conference about “Shared Sacred Places&amp;nbsp;and Multi-Religious Space” that took place at the Leibniz Institute of European History&amp;nbsp;(IEG) in Mainz in September 2016. As the title of the conference indicates, a main&amp;nbsp;interest was to re-think the relation between place and space and between different&amp;nbsp;religions. The conference took place in the framework of the IEG focus topic “Europe&amp;nbsp;from the Margins,” which also included a lecture series on processes of marginalization&amp;nbsp;and exclusion with regard to social and religious minorities within and beyond Europe.&amp;nbsp;This background explains the range of topics in this special issue to a certain degree,&amp;nbsp;because the conference had the aim to de-centre established notions of Europe and&amp;nbsp;religion and understand them in their multi-dimensionality. While cross-faith practices&amp;nbsp;are a worldwide phenomenon, the main geographical focus of the following articles is&amp;nbsp;on southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean with their spatial extensions to Asia.&amp;nbsp;Proceeding from here, the contributions in this volume understand multi-faith practices&amp;nbsp;as embedded in local arrangements as well as in larger multi-religious landscapes,&amp;nbsp;thus taking account of the interconnection between the local and the global and paying&amp;nbsp;attention to the micro and macro levels of analysis.</dc:description>
